# Bazel-Hands-On

## Prerequisites

Start by [installing Bazel](https://bazel.build/install), if you havenâ€™t already. This tutorial uses Git for source control, so for best results [install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) as well.

Next, retrieve the sample project from Bazel's GitHub repository by running the following in your command-line tool of choice:

```
git clone https://github.com/GideokKim/Bazel-Hands-On.git
```
